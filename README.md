# üî•/‚ùÑÔ∏è Nav: The Hot or Cold Distance Tracker

## Overview

Ever played the "Hot or Cold" game as a kid? Well, this is it, but with a *geographical* twist! üî•/‚ùÑÔ∏è Nav is a fun web app that tells you how close you are to a destination you choose. The catch? It doesn't show you the *direction*, just the *distance*. And to make things even more interesting, it gives you "hot" or "cold" visual cues as you get closer or further from your target!

## How it Works

1.  **Pick a Spot:** Type in any location in the world (thanks to Google Maps integration).
2.  **Start Tracking:** Hit the "Start Tracking" button.
3.  **Get Moving:** Start walking, running, driving, or even flying! The app will track your distance from the chosen destination.
4.  **Feel the Heat (or Cold):**
    *   Getting closer? The button turns fiery red! üî•
    *   Moving away? You'll see a chilly blue. ‚ùÑÔ∏è
    *   The distance updates in real-time, with smooth animations.
    *   Visual feedback fades after 10 seconds of inactivity.
